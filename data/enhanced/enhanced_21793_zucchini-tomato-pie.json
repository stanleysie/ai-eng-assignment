        "text": "I followed the other suggestions and ramped up the flavor with Italian herbs and garlic. I increased the parmesan cheese and made it a meal with protein by pre-cooking in a skillet, 1/2 italian ground sausage and 1/2 lean hamburger. I sauteed the onions until carmelized and also cooked the zucchini and tomatoes separately in skillets and drained well befre mixing. I also had some pizza dough on hand so I weaved a top crust to give it some crunch and add to the presentation.",
