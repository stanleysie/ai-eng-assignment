I followed the advice of others by making the following tweaks: (1) I used a half cup of sugar and one-and-a-half cups of brown sugar; (2) I omitted the water; (3) I added a teaspoon of cream of tartar to the batter; (4) I refrigerated the batter for at least an hour before scooping and baking. The cookies retained their shape and didn't spread when baked. I think the cream of tartar made a difference, and the cookies did not come out too cakey either!
