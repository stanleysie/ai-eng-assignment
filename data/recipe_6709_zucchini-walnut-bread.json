I did tweak it a bit, but I always like to add a bit extra ;) I doubled the recipe and replaced a cup of the zucchini with some grated carrots because my zucchini wasn’t big enough, and it added a lovely color to the bread when I cut it. I used golden raisins instead of regular because I like the flavor and look of them better, as well. I also replaced half of the white sugar with brown to give it a richer flavor and color. Finally, I added some more spices like nutmeg and clove and extra cinnamon. Fabulous recipe!",
