      "text": "Who knew croutons would be so darn easy. We had some leftover three-cheese bread from Panera that was going stale. I cut it up, tossed in a ziploc bag as another reviewer recommended, poured the butter in and tossed. Put on a couple cookie sheets and baked it up! I did turn the croutons half-way through baking, and the cheese bread took much longer than the 15 minutes. We've already ate half of the batch just snacking!",
