        "text": "The first batch that I made was a bit bland. But I did love that they weren't flat! They are a nice thick, chewy cookie. The second batch I used 1 tsp. of salt instead of 1/2 tsp. and omitted the nuts. This was better, but still not quite as flavorful at the traditional Tollhouse cookie recipe. I found that if I pressed them down slightly before baking that worked the best.If I were to rate this recipe on look and texture, it would be a 5. But the flavor falls a bit flat for me. I may keep trying to see how I can make it taste better, but maintain the aesthetic.",
